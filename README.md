# ServerPlayerCounter

THIS IS NOT MY MOD. I have decompiled [Sindusk's mod](https://forum.wurmonline.com/index.php?/topic/146427-released-server-server-player-counter/),
and edited that.

This mod aims to improve upon the vanilla player counter, which seems to be inaccurate at times.
The difference between my version and the original is that alts do not count as separate players.
This is done by counting the different steam IDs, meaning two players from
the same IP address will still count as two, as long as they don't use the same steam account.
